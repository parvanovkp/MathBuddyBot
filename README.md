# MathBuddyBot

MathBuddyBot is an intelligent chatbot designed to assist with mathematical problems up to Calculus 1 level. It leverages LangChain and DSPY to optimize queries, which are then processed by a GPT-4o model via the OpenAI API to generate step-by-step solutions. For enhanced accuracy, all calculations are performed using Python libraries or the Wolfram Alpha API. The final output is rendered in LaTeX for clear, professional-looking mathematical notation.

## Key Features:
- Natural language understanding of mathematical queries
- Query optimization using LangChain and DSPY
- Advanced problem-solving capabilities powered by GPT-4o
- Accurate computations via Python libraries and Wolfram Alpha
- LaTeX rendering for precise mathematical output
